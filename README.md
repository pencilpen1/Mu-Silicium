## lancelot / Redmi 9

`Platforms/Xiaomi/lancelotPkg` is the active MT6768 platform port. Its display
configuration uses the Android runtime framebuffer (`0x7cdb0000`, visible
`1080x2340`, stride `1088`) and the GOP opaque-pixel workaround documented in
the porting guide. The bundled porting kit contains the validated MUSB device
mode diagnostic driver, runtime captures, tests, and migration notes. The MUSB
diagnostic driver is now integrated into the lancelot DXE/APRIORI build.
